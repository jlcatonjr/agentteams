# Security Policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Status                  |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| 1.x     | Active support          |
| 0.x     | Unsupported (pre-1.0)   |

Security fixes are backported only to the most recent minor release of the
current major. Once 2.0 ships, 1.x will receive critical security fixes for
six months and then move to unsupported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Email: **james@visualknowledge.us** with subject prefix `[agentteams-security]`.

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof-of-concept.
- The agentteams version (`agentteams --version`) and Python version.
- Whether the issue is exploitable from CLI input, from a malicious project
  description, from a malicious git remote, or from a malicious template.

You will receive an acknowledgement within **3 business days**. A fix
target and disclosure schedule will be communicated within **10 business
days** of acknowledgement.

## Threat model

`agentteams` is a code-generation tool that runs locally and writes files
to a target project directory. The following are considered in-scope
threats:

- **Untrusted project descriptions.** A malicious `_build-description.json`
  or `agent-team.md` should not cause arbitrary file writes outside the
  target project directory, command injection, or code execution.
- **Untrusted templates.** A malicious template file should not exfiltrate
  environment variables or execute shell commands at render time.
- **Destructive flag misuse.** Flags like `--overwrite`, `--prune`, and
  `--migrate` are gated by the security-decision system documented in
  [`agentteams/security_refs.py`](agentteams/security_refs.py). Bypassing
  that gate without using the documented `--yes` interaction is a
  vulnerability.
- **Snapshot-tag handling.** `--migrate` writes a `pre-fencing-snapshot`
  git tag and `--revert-migration` restores from it. Losing or silently
  moving that tag without user consent is a vulnerability.

Out of scope:
- Vulnerabilities that require the attacker to already have write access
  to the target project directory.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party tools agentteams delegates to (git, the
  user's editor, downstream LLM CLIs).
- Bugs in generated agent files themselves — agentteams is a generator,
  not a runtime; generated outputs are the user's responsibility to review.

## Security-relevant changes in this release

See the `### security` blocks of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). For 1.0
specifically:
- `--migrate` gate exemption is in-process only (no CLI flag).
- `--revert-migration` is intentionally ungated (it is the recovery path).
- `--migrate` no longer hard-errors on a stale snapshot tag; with `--yes`
  it moves the tag to current HEAD.
